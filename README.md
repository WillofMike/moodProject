# MOOD.

## Motivation
99% of people love music, and they also have their favorite bands and artists that they go to all of the time. However, sometimes people need something new. We get tired of the same Artist and same song everyday. Often people will ask friends or search on the internet for new bands/artists. However sometimes we are recommended music that just doesn't fit how we are feeling at that particular time. We need something that can give us a list of music based on how we are doing that day.

MOOD. is an app that generates a playlist of 10 songs based on the weather where the user is and on the users mood and emotional state at that time.
